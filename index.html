                    Born and raised in San Diego, I grew up playing soccer and video games, the latter in which started
                    my love for technology. I started my foray into cybersecurity early in middle school after trying
                    to mimic the Anonymous hacks that I saw online. This then morphed into a greater love for all
                    things technology, leading me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Cal Poly Pomona.
                    During this time, I started playing Pickleball since it was easy to pick up and fun to play. It was
                    also easier on my back that was beat up during my time playing varsity soccer and lacrosse
                    in high school. Finally, I really dug deep into horror movies (especially psychological horror)
                    during the pandemic, and I am always looking for the next film that will give me a scare that lasts
                    weeks.
