            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>
                Horror is a genre that I absolutely love. While the scares and suspense are thrilling,
                my actual love for horror comes from common societal fears that these movies explore. For example,
                most classic horror movies from the 70s and 80s often reflected societal fears of the time,
                such as the breakdown of the traditional family unit, rise in technology, and religious anxieties.

                This found-footage horror film takes viewers deep into the catacombs beneath Paris.
                What starts as an archaeological expedition becomes a terrifying descent into hell itself.
                This one is my all-time favorite due to the intense atmosphere throughout the entire film, and,
                as a fan of the occult, the themes of alchemy and "lost knowledge" is my favorite aspect of the film.
                Finally, the film mimicking the structure of Dante's Inferno really just brought it all together for me.

            <h3>Hereditary (2018)</h3>

            <p>
                My favorite A24 horror film, "Hereditary" is the perfect psychological horror movie. The
                film explores themes of grief, trauma, and family secrets, all while delivering some really
                unsettling moments. As previously mentioned, I enjoy horror movies that explore the occult,
                and "Hereditary" does this in a way that feels fresh and original. While there weren't many
                jump scares, the atmosphere and tension throughout the film keeps you glued to the screen.

            <h3>Heretic (2024)</h3>

            <p>
                Last but not least, as someone that studied world religions as a pastime hobby, "Heretic"
                exploring religious fanaticism resonated with me on a personal level. I really enjoyed how
                the film explored the dangers of blind faith and the consequences of religious extremism,
                along with the idea that religion was just a tool to control and manipulate the masses. While
                this movie wasn't "scary" in the traditional sense, the film did a great job of building
                a very tense atmosphere in which even the viewer didn't know who to trust or what was real.
